            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177222:3"/> of sinne, death and Satan, by mortifying the old Adam vvith the lusts and likings therof through liuely faith, driuen avvay the mist of ignorance and misbeleef from our mindes by the lyght of his gracious Gospell, that vve myght vvalke vvithout stumbling as in the open daylight: and finally taughte vs all thyngs necessarie as vvell to the atteynment of the immortalitie to come, as to the leading of a godlie, quiet and happie lyfe heere, by exercising the dueties of mutuall loue and charitie among our selues: but also (lest any thing might vvant to the strengthning and incouraging of vs to goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and to hold out cōstantly to the end of our race) hath armed vs ageinst all temptations, hart bytings and stumblingblocks, by vvarning vs aforehād vvhat thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should happen to his Churche from tyme to tyme too the ende of the vvorlde, vvhat revvardes are layd vp in heauen for the godly, and vvhat punishementes shall finally fall vppon the vvicked. For he knovving both the vvilinesse of the olde serpent raging and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping lyke a hungerstaruen Lyon disappoynted of his pray, and the spitefull malice of the vvorld vvhiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sette altogither vppon naughtinesse fyghteth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vvith tooth and nayle ageinst the truth and the professers therof: and thervnto hovv fraile and vveake vvee be of ourselues, insomuch that although there be a vvillingnesse in vs to persist in his seruice through the vvorking of his holie spirite, yet vve fynde no povver and abilitie to performe that desire, furtherfoorth than vve be vphilde and maynteyned by his mightie hande from aboue: He (I say) knovving all these things vvel ynough, hath alvvayes like a most prouident houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:177222:3"/> and foreseeing vvatcheman, foretold his seruaunts of the inconueniences to come, that they mighte not be so astonished or amazed vvith the suddaynnesse or gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnesse of them, as to quayle or shrinke at any perill, persecution, or misfortune, but alvvays comfort them selues vvith the certaintie of Gods prouidence and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his helpe. This did he vvhen he told Abraham that his seede shoulde be a soiourner in a strange lande, vvhere they should be brought in bondage, and misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. 400. yeares. This didde hee vvhen hee tolde the people of Iuda and Ierusalem that they shoulde bee caried avvaye too Babylon, and there serue the Chaldeis. 70. yeares. This did he vvhen by the mouth of his chozen vessell Saint Paule he tolde the ministers and elders of the Churche of Ephesus that greeuous vvolues and speakers of levvde things should rise vp, vvhiche should not spare the flocke. Finally, this hath he done through all ages and all times bothe vnder the lavve and vnder the Gospell, as vvell in the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament as in the nevve: and specially in this presente Reuelation to his holie seruant Saincte Iohn, vvhiche according to the name thereof, conteyneth a mysticall discouerie of the vvholestate of the Church, from the first setting foorth ad preaching of the Gospell, euen vnto the ende of the vvorlde. VVhiche thing surely is so muche the more needefull, bicause that mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grovving dayly more and more into decay vvith the perishing vvorlde novve hasting too his ende, is more subiecte too corruption, and lesse gyuen too Godlynesse and vertue than euer it vvas: and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell perceyuing his kingdome vppon earth to dravve
<pb facs="tcp:177222:4"/> apace too vtter ruine, laboureth the more earnestly to vvorke all the spight and mischief he can to Christ and his members. And therefore Christe oure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, high Priest and King, being not ignorant of the perillousnesse of these latter days, vvherin the fury of Antichryst shoulde rage farre extremelyer than euer it had doone since the first creation of things: not onely forevvarneth, but also armeth vs in this booke, that vve mighte haue continuall comforte and patience by his Scriptures. Novv although the Commentaries of that learned and godlie father doctour Bullinger opening and expounding these mysticall reuelations, haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore bin translated, and be alredy stil extant in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tung: in respect vvherof it might seeme that this labor of myne might the better haue bin spared in that behalf: yetnotvvithstanding forasmuch as Gods spirit the fountaine of all knovvledge and vnderstanding, sheadeth himself into vvhome hee vvill, and in vvhat maner and measure he vvill, and vseth the sundrie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of mens vvittes diuersly too the furtherance of Chrystes kingdome, and the aduancement of Gods glorie: I doubt not but that this vvorke vvill be found to be both profitable and necessarie, to such as reade it vvith a christianly mynde of beeing edifyed to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not vvith a curious fansie of seeking straunge and vncouth things. For the vvord of God serueth too feede mens soules vnto eternall lyfe, and not to delight their eares vvith transitorie pleasantnesse. And maister Marlorat that peinful labourer in Gods vineyard, vvho in the end sealed vp the testimony of Iesus Christ vvith the expence of his ovvne bloud, hath briefly conueyed
<pb facs="tcp:177222:4"/> into this his vvorke, the vvhole substaunce of matter, vvhich all the late vvriters of our times haue set dovvn in vvriting for the better opening of this present Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And vvhere as hee to auoyde tediousnesse, and to bring his booke into the lesse rome, had referred the reader to other places of his former expositions vppon other partes of the Scripture: I to ease the reader of his labour in seeking them vvhere they be translated, and to supply his vvant of them vvhere they be not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, haue sought oute those places, &amp; from thence conueyed bothe his matter and vvordes into this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, and set them in their proper roomes, as largely or briefly as the presente purpose seemed to require, Novve therefore it may please your honour of youre accustomed goodnesse tovvardes mee, or rather of youre loue to the setting foorthe of Gods glorie (vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is vvell knovvne to be moste earnest and vnfained) too accept this trauell of myne, vvhich being dedicated to your name, is set foorth to the stablishment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes kingdom and common vvealth in this realme; and to the speciall comforte of suche as are vnder the crosse, and fynde not any succour or reliefe at the handes of men. Finished at my lodging in London the last day of August. 1574.</p>

Howbeit, euen at this day the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the holie scriptures are scarsly agréed of the author or rather of the writer of it. All of them doe graunt in déed, (which thing also the text it selfe dothe manifestly auouche) that he was called Iohn, whosoeuer he was, that was the wryter of this Reuelation. But forasmuche as many men, and those not of the meanest sort, euen in the tyme of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, did beare the name of Iohn: it is doubted among lerned men euen at this day, who this Iohn should be. They that denie him to haue bin the Apostle and Euangeliste, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be moued by likely coniectures: yet are not their coniectures of sufficient force to proue that whiche they goe about. But to omit their reasons whiche are washed away
<pb facs="tcp:177222:24"/> nowe long agoe by menne of singular learning: we must assure our selues, that the coniecture of them is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whiche haue fathered this holie Booke replenished with incredible comfort, eyther vpon Iohn the Apostle, or vppon Marke, who also was surnamed Iohn. Moreouer the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that are sette foorth in this prophecie darkly, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner riddlelyke, muste not hinder the godlie from readyng of it. For Iohn doth therefore vse figures, bicause the thing that he writeth is a Reuelation, which it pleaseth God to disclose vnto him vnder suche manner of figures: which thing euen the Prophets dyd: wherevpon also all this booke is called a Prophecie, Chap. 1. verse. 3. &amp;. 22. b. 7. d. 18.19. Besides this, it was muche more wisdome to foretell the destruction of the Romane Empire (which at that time bare sway almost ouer the whole worlde) vnder the couerts of figures, than in open speeche, least the Romane Princes should rage more cruelly agaynst the Christians euen in that respecte: and yet for all that, the godly mindes were to be quickened and comforted by this prophesie, agaynst their most cruell persecutions. So Paule. 2. Thessal. 2.7.8. &amp;c. chose rather to poynt out the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fall of the Romishe Antichrist couertly, than by playne words. Notwithstanding, this booke shall be simple, playne, and cleare to the faythfull, so they reade it aduisedly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently. I confesse in déede that the auncient Interpreters haue oftentimes béene graueled in the expounding of it, and that they coulde not alwayes winde them selues out: but yet it is well knowne by the way, that euen they themselues haue more than once sayde, howe this booke should scarse be able to bée vnderstoode, vntill it were fulfilled: and that then it should bée easie to bée vnderstoode of euery man without trouble. Likewyse to the Fathers of olde tyme, Daniel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177222:24"/> shall haue read this booke of Reuelation aduisedly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye, and haue compared the thynges whiche it spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnder couerte, with those things that stories do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to bée doone: wée shall saye, that euen this Booke also vttereth mere Histories. For it declareth (althoughe vnder figures, yet more euidentlye than the Propets) what is the state of Christes kingdome, what is the lotte of the Churche, and to what persecutions they bée subiecte, as manie as are earnestly bente to the Christian Religion. Furthermore it peynteth out vnto vs a description of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and of all his malice and mischiefe, and setteth before our eyes the dreadfull torments of hell and damnation. Also it openeth Heauen vnto vs, and sheweth moste euidently what is the true hope of the faithful. Againe, it auoucheth the true resurrection of all fleshe: Finally it sheweth (and that moste plenteously, what shall be the ende at length bothe of the chosen, and the reprobates, and of the faithful and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, what is the soueraine goodnesse, and what is the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoste miserie and vnhappinesse: so as this booke (euen for the verie matter that it treateth of, and teacheth) commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it selfe too all the Godlie, shewyng (yea and euen prouyng) it selfe too bée wrytten by the indytyng of the holye Ghoste. In manye respectes therefore is it woorthye too bée redde wyth all diligence, and to be thoroughly weyed of all learned menne: specially in these laste and most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous tymes, the whiche thys prophesie concerneth. For if (as méete is) wée bée willyng too bryng wyth vs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende mynde and desiriousnesse to learne, which of right is due to the reading of the holy Scriptures, no man can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily expresse how much profit wyll redounde vnto vs by this prophesie.

                  </hi> It is a verye ryfe sentence in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Of woorkes and how they iustifie not.</note> and is miswrested, by such as indeuer to proue, that we bée iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed by oure owne workes, bycause we bee iudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording too them, whereas notwithstanding there is no suche thyng meant. They consider not that a trée is discerned by hys fruites, and yet that the frute causeth not the trée to bée thys or that, but the trée causeth the fruite to be suche. As for example, when a man sées figges vppon a tree, he iudgeth it too bée a figge trée: and yet the figge tree tooke not his béeing of the figges: but for bycause it was a figge tree,
<pb facs="tcp:177222:74"/> therefore it brought foorth that kind of frute. Euen so in all kind of things the worke yéeldeth iudgement of the worker, and yet maketh not the worker, but is made or done by the worker. After the same manner, good woorks declare a man to be good and to be the child of God, but they make him not good. A man therefore is not iustifyed (that is to say made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God) by works, which can be nothing but sinne to damne him withall, if they be done before he be clenzed and renewed by the holy Ghost, bycause an euil trée cannot bring foorth good frutes. Neuerthelesse, the Lord in describing hys iudgement, sayth (after the manner of man) that the same is executed according to euery mans déedes: verely euen as we bée wont to iudge, and yet by saying that he will gyue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one according to his works, he méeneth not to make our works the cheefe cause of our welfare.<note place="margin">The causes of euerlasting lyfe.</note> For of his giuing vnto vs eternall life, the firste cause is his owne voluntarie good will: which also is the first cause of all things. The seconde is Christes merites: for he dyed for the welfare of the whole worlde: and yet euen that also is the frée gift of Gods good wyll. The third is fayth, whereby we receiue and embrace the good will of God and the merites of Christ: for he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeueth hath life euerlasting. Iohn. <hi>3</hi> d. <hi>36.</hi> And yet euen fayth also is the worke and gift of God, who is well pleased with vs for Christes deserts. Lastly also good woorks may haue the name of a cause (howbeit vnproperly) bycause euery man is rewarded according to hys woorkes. But yet good woorkes themselues are the gifts of Gods good will, the effects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes merites, and the frutes of fayth. For no worke can bée counted good before God which is not done of loue and good will to Godward: but loue and good will to Godward is in none but such as beléeue in God: and to beléeue in God no man is able but he that is indewed with the holy Ghoste: whych holy Ghost God giueth to those only whome he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for his owne children, and whose sinnes he hath forgiuen for Christes sake: but neyther releaseth he any mens sinnes,

For it is all one as if he had sayd, Thyngs neuer went so wretchedly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177222:124"/> in this world, nor there neuer appéered so many and so great signes of Gods wrath. But héere it is demaunded,<note place="margin">An obiection with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere why so great plagues should followe the Gospel.</note> howe it may agrée that so huge a sea of inconueniences should flowe out togither with the manifestation of Christ. For it may séeme against reason, that wheras hée is the onely pledge of Gods loue towards mankynd, in whom the heauenly father layeth foorth all the treasures of his goodnesse, or rather in whom hée powreth out the bowelles of his mercie vpon vs: yet notwithstāding Gods wrath burneth more fiercely since his comming than it did before, so as it catcheth hold both of heauen and earth as it were with one flame at once. First it is to be considered, that for asmuch as men are ouerflowen in receyuing Christ, they must bée quickened vp with diuers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as it were with squorges. Secondly wheras Christ calleth them vnto him that be distressed and heauy loden with miseries, we cannot learne that lowlynesse, till we be tamed with manie miseries. For through the prosperous state of their affaires, men take stout and proud stomacks vnto them, and it cannot be but that he which wéeneth himselfe to be well at ease, will presumpteously despise Christ. Thirdly, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we be ouerforeward in séeking the ease of the fleshe, wherevpon it comes to passe, that many men tye the grace of Christ to this present lyfe: it is for our behoofe to be inured too the contrarie opinion, to the end we may know that Christs kingdome is spiritual. And therefore God of purpose to teach vs that Christs goodes are heauenly, exercyseth vs with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles as touching the flesh. Wherby it commeth to passe that we séeke our happinesse out of the worlde. Also the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse of men increaseth the heape of miseries. For the seruant that knoweth his masters wil and doeth it not, is worthy of sorer punishment. Luke. <hi>12.</hi> f. <hi>47.</hi> The more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly that God dealeth with vs in Christ, the more dothe our vnkindnesse increase &amp; burst out into open stubbornesse. So is it no maruell at all though many signes of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance appéere at the open preaching of Christ, considering that
<pb facs="tcp:177222:125"/> men on their behalfe, do by their wicked contempte prouoke God the more gréeuously, and set his wrath the more on fire against them. And therefore whereas Iohn sayth, that the sonne shall become blacke and the Moone bluddy: they be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue spéeches,<note place="margin">Figuratiue speeches.</note> wherby he méeneth, that the Lord shall shewe foorth such signes of his wrath through the whole frame of the world, as shal set men beside their wits for feare, as though the whole order of nature shoulde horribly turne topsiteruie. For lyke as the Sunne and the Moone are witnesses of Gods fatherly loue towards vs, when they yéeld lyght to the earth in these turnes: so on the contrary part, he sayth they shall bée messengers of Gods wrath and sore displeasure.

Act. <hi>17.</hi> f. <hi>28.</hi> For his meaning is that wée bée (after a sorte) conteyned in God, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs by his power.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:177222:189"/> name of <hi>yehouah,</hi> is that wée might knowe, how that (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per spéech) he only is of him selfe, and that we haue our béeing in him, in asmuch as he quickneth and vpholdeth vs with hys spirite: for the power of his spirite is shed abroad through all parts of the world, to maynteyne them in their state, and too giue that freshnesse to heauen &amp; earth which we sée in them, &amp; also to giue mouing to all liuing things. And forasmuch as the life of man is more excellent than mouing, and mouing is more excellent thā only béeing: Paule hath placed that thing foremost which is chiefest, to the intent to come down to bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by degrées in this wise: we not only haue not any life, sauing in God, but also wée haue not any mouing, no nor any béeing (which is inferiour vnto both the other) but in him. Wée say that the life beareth preheminence in men, bicause they not only haue cōmon sence and mouing as well as brute beasts haue: but also are endued with reason &amp; vnderstāding. Worthily therfore dothe the Scripture aduaunce this singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gifte wherwithall God hath endued vs, with peculiar ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of commendation by it selfe.

                  <note place="margin">Christes reig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning.</note> It is the cause why the godly reioyce and prayse God.

But the pride of Antichrist is so great, that he thinks he may alter times and lawes, that is to say, ordeine all things at his owne will and pleasure.

<pb facs="tcp:177222:228"/> many expositions as there be expositors. Whereby it appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it is very darke and riddlelike. The cause seemeth to be, for that Iohn hath simply set downe the number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding of Mooneths, yeeres, weekes, dayes, or any other things whereof it should be the number. By reason héereof the fathers haue descanted diuersly vpon the number of the name of the beast or of Antichrist. Some haue thought that he shuld haue some certaine name, which in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> number of hys letters should yéeld the said number, according to the manner of reckning vsed by the Gréeks or Latins. And so (after some mens iudgemēts) Antichrist should be called in Gréeke <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temos,</hi> and in Latin <hi>Diclux</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antemos and Diclux.</note> which is a feyned word. But how shall we be assured that Antichrist shall haue some such kind of name, as the letters thereof shall yéeld such a number? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, although it were true that he should haue such a name as he might be knowen by the letters of number placed in the same: yet shoulde that be done, rather by the Hebrue let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than either by Greeke or Latin letters, and according to such a name, not as he taketh to himselfe, but as fitteth hym according to the truth of the matter. And therefore Ireneus doth well in his booke against all heresies, where he chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth those that are curious in searching out the name of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist after that maner: more rightly thē do some refer this nūber to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of Antichrists reigne, as well of his cōming in, as of his wearing out: to the intent that the godly myghte both withstand the enterāces of his reigning, and also beare the cōtinuance of it the more patiently. For we are sure that God hath limited the time of his reigne certaine, although it be vnknowen vnto vs, except it be reueled to vs by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same spirit that Iohn spake this by. Notwithstanding, he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to thinke vpō it aduisedly, and to search for it busily. Who so hath vnderstanding (saith he) let him recken y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beast &amp;c. In which sense it was said to the king of Babylon, God hath numbred thy kingdom, Da. <hi>5.</hi> g. <hi>26</hi> that is to say, the time of thy reigne. For as soone as the threscore
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:177222:228"/> and ten yéeres of the thraldome of Gods people which Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had foretold, were fulfilled: thē was the end of his reigne and kingdome at hande. Therefore it is all one as if Iohn should say, like as the reignes of men cannot be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but are bounded by God within a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yéeres: euen so is Antichrists reigne also. Which thing is spoken to the comfort of the godly, least they might thinke the reigne of Antichrist to be without end. For it shall haue an end, and it shall giue place to Christes kingdome as well as all others do. Happie is he then which vnderstandeth thys number of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beast, that is to say, to whome it is giuen of God to knowe that the power of Antichrist (whyche séemeth too bée inuincible and euerlasting) shall haue a time to perish.</p>

For he sholeth it out from the common state of mē, among whom nothing is sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast or continuall. For there is nothing vnder the Sunne, (bee it neuer so well settled) whiche is not subiecte to diuers chaunges. But the Church must not bée déemed by the perills of this present life: for shée shall bée preserued euen in the middes of the waues. As if a man should say, Value not thy welfare by the present countenance of things: but assure thy selfe it is layde vp safe in God. God will bee thy Sunne, so as thou shalt not néede too borowe lyghte of the Sunne or of the Moone. Feare not then any chaunge or alteratiō of thy state: for thou shalte haue an euerlasting and vnchaungeable light. The Prophet meaneth not by these words, that the children of God shall bée refte of the common benefytes of this life. For sith the Lorde graunteth them fréely too all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
